# Blinkit-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project presents a data-driven analysis of Blinkit's operational performance using a Power BI dashboard. It covers key metrics including total and average sales, product distribution, customer satisfaction, and outlet trends. Through rich visualizations and KPI tracking, the analysis uncovers insights such as consumer preference for low-fat products, the dominance of fruits and snack foods in sales, and the profitability of medium-sized outlets in Tier 3 locations. The dashboard supports strategic decision-making by providing a clear view of business performance across various dimensions.
